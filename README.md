# UFRN Budget Application
	
Have you ever asked yourself how your University/School spend its incomes?

Here we decide to make that question, so we accessed the open data website from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)
to analyse how its budget is being applied.

The idea of this project is to perform analysis on several dataSets and present insights about this subject.

## The dataset:
The dataSet consists in different types of expenses related to UFRN activities. In general the dataSets
are CSV files and we use the Anaconda + Jupyter / Collab Notebook to perform the analysis.

These dataSets can be found on [UFRN open data](http://dados.ufrn.br/).
